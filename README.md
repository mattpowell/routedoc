# routedoc &mdash; _documentation for routes._
> `routedoc` is a tool for documenting and generating urls.

Motivation
==========
Urls are important and having a tool that allows them to be documented in one place helps developers maintain and evolve them as their site/app grows and changes. Many backend frameworks have their own routing built-in, but rarely can you use those routes in other frameworks, other backends, or even on the client-side. The goal of this project is to provide a flexible and human-readable format to document urls that can be used by various clients, backends, and environments.

Installation
============
To install and use as a module in your nodejs toolchain, run:
```
npm install routedoc
```
To install as a command line program, run:
```
npm install routedoc -g
```

Example
=======
```
/**
 * Api endpoint for searching the database
 * @name api-search
 * @param {string} q - text to query for.
 * @returns {SearchResultsJson}
 */
GET /api/:table/search
```
Running the above through `routedoc`, like:
```
routedoc --conf ./routes
```
-- or --
```
routedoc < ./routes
```
will generate the following JSON:
```json
[{
  "method": "GET",
  "name": "api-search",
  "doc": "Api endpoint for searching the database",
  "path": {
    "value": "/api/:table/search"
  },
  "params": {
    "q": {
      "doc": "text to query for.",
      "type": {
        "type": "NameExpression",
        "name": "string"
      }
    },
    "table": {
      "type": {
        "type": "NameExpression",
        "name": "string"
      },
      "doc": null
    }
  },
  "returns": {
    "type": {
      "type": "NameExpression",
      "name": "SearchResultsJson"
    },
    "doc": null
  },
  "tags": {}
}]
```
From there, it's up to you what you do with the JSON. You can transform it in to something that your framework of choice consumes, generate html docs, automatically create HTTP acceptance tests, or use one of the libraries below.

TODO
====
- [ ] Support multiple route files
- [ ] Api for generating urls from a route (e.g., `routedoc.toUrl('api-search', { q: 'routedoc'})` => `'/search?q=routedoc'`)
  - Note this will probably exist in it's own repo.
- [ ] ...?
